# DW3XXX bare metal low-level drivers

## Overview

This repository contains the bare metal low-level drivers for the DW3000, DW3720, QM33xxx series of UWB (Ultra-Wideband) devices. These drivers provide essential functionalities to interface with the hardware and perform basic operations. This is a generic package that can be used with most Microcontroller Units (MCUs) given that a correct configuration is provided.

A package called simple-examples is released by Qorvo to showcase how to use the drivers but a custom implementation of these drivers can be easily achieved.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone git@gitlab.com:qorvo/uwb-eng/dw3xxx/dwt_uwb_driver.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd dwt_uwb_driver
  ```
3. Add the drivers to your project.
